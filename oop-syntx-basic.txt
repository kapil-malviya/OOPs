# Object :

    Pysical existence of a class is nothing but object. We can create any number of objects for a class.
    Syntax to create object : 
        referencevariable = classname()
    Example : 
        s = Student()


# Reference Variable :

    The variable which can be used to refer object is called reference variable.
    By using reference variable, we can access properties and methods of object.


# Self variable :

    self is the default variable which is always pointing to current object 
    by using self we can access instance variables and instance methods of object.

Note :
    - self should be first parameter inside constructor
        def __init__(self):
    - self should be first parameter inside instance methods
        def talk(self)


# Constructor Concept :

    - Constructor is a special method in python.
    - The name of the constructor should be __init__(self)
    - Constructor will be executed automatically at the time of object creation.
    - The main purpose of constructor is to declare and initialize instance variables.
    - Per object constructor will be exeucte only once.
    - Constructor can take atleast one argument (atleast self)
    - Constructor is optional and if we are not providing any constructor then python will 
        provide default constructor.

Example :

def __init__(self,name,rollno,marks):
    self.name=name
    self.rollno=rollno
    self.marks=marks 



Differences between Methods and Constructors : 

# Method =>> function declared inside a class is method

- Name of method can be any name 
- Method will be executed if we call that method
- Per object, method can be called any number of times.
- Inside method we can write business logic

# Constructor =>>

- Constructor name should be always __init__
- Constructor will be executed automatically at the time of object creation.
- Per object, Constructor will be executed only once
- Inside Constructor we have to declare and initialize instance variables





# Variables  &  Methods --> 

==> Within the Python class we can represent data by using variables. 
    There are 3 types of variables are allowed =>> 
        
    - static variables (Class Level Variables)
    - instance variables(non-static variables) (object related variable) (Object Level Variables)
    - local variables (Method Level Variables)

==> Within the Python class, we can represent operations by using methods. 
    The following are various types of allowed methods =>>

    - Static Methods
    - Instance Methods (non-static methods)
    - Class Methods
