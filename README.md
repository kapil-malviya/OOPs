## Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code into reusable and self-contained objects. 
In this section, we explore the fundamental concepts of OOP and its advantages.

## Classes and Objects

Learn how to define classes and create objects, along with understanding various types of variables like instance, static, 
local, and global variables.

## Methods

Explore different types of methods in Python classes, including instance, class and static methods. Understand the role of 
`self` and `cls` in methods and discover the use of properties through the `@property` decorator.

## Inheritance

Dive into the world of inheritance, where classes inherit attributes and behaviors from other classes. Learn about different 
types of inheritance and how to use the `super()` method to access parent class members.

## Polymorphism

Discover the power of polymorphism, which allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. 
Explore method overloading, method overriding, and operator overloading.

## Advanced Concepts

Take your OOP skills to the next level with advanced topics such as interfaces, abstract classes, and access modifiers 
(public, protected, and private attributes). Understand the importance of garbage collection in managing memory. Understand 
the setter and getter method.
